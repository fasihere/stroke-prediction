Stroke Prediction using different machine learning techniques.
We analysed the provided data for different people and investigated the correlations between different features.
Then, we compared the performance of different models to choose the best one to predict whether a person may suffer from a stroke, given the data of the person.
MLP Classifier was the best model with a score of 0.98142.
